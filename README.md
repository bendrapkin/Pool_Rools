# 8-Ball Rules

## Object of the Game

The game starts with the balls in break position, and two teams take turns hitting the white ball with the cue until one team legally pockets the black ball.

## Teams

Each team consists of at least one person.
There need not be the same number of players on each team.
Only one person may play per turn.
Players in a team must be assigned an order before the game starts, and each consecutive turn for a team must cycle through players in that team in that order.

## Break

The tip of the triangle needs to be situated on the foot spot (or within a 1cm diameter of this spot). The cue ball needs to be situated behind the head string. If both teams agree, they can agree to re-rack the balls for any reason and no penalty is served. If the cue ball is pocketed, the other team does not gain ball in hand but rather must place the cue ball behind the head string and must first strike any colored ball on the other side of the head string. If the 8 ball is pocketed on the break, the game is won by the team that broke.

## Turns

If you declare which target ball you will pot in which pocket before taking your shot, and legally pot the called ball in the called pocket, then your team may take another shot.
If you declare the shot a 'safety' before taking the shot, then your team's turn will end after taking that shot; otherwise, your team must take another shot.

### Fouls

Your shot is a foul if it doesn't satisfy all of the following conditions:

1. the first ball touched by the white is one of your team's target balls

Your shot is a foul if it satisfies any of the following conditions:

1. the white ball is potted
2. no ball touches a cushion or is potted after the white ball first makes contact with the object ball
5. the white doesn't touch any of your team's target balls
3. the shot is taken before all balls are stationary
6. you touch any non-white ball with anything other than the white ball
1. If the white ball is touching one of your target balls at the start of your shot, then that target ball is considered to have been hit first during your shot.
2. It is not a foul if the white ball is touching one of your opponent's target balls at the start of your shot.

If your shot is not a foul, then it is a legal shot. 
Committing a foul ends your turn and grants your opponent ball-in-hand.
